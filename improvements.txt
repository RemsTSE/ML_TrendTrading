Improvement Plan
1. Integrate Additional News Sources for Data Collection
Objective: Enhance data collection by adding more news sources or APIs that can provide historical data beyond the last 30 days.
Approach:
Research and select relevant news APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Financial Modeling Prep, CoinGecko, CryptoCompare) that support historical news data and cover the Bitcoin market.
Implement a modular design to add news collectors for different APIs with minimal changes to the existing code.
Design a fallback mechanism to switch between APIs if one reaches its limit.
2. Enable Market Selection for Data Collection
Objective: Allow the user to select specific markets (e.g., Stock, Forex, Crypto) and have the collectors target these markets accordingly.
Approach:
Define a configuration file or input method to allow the selection of markets.
Implement dynamic news and market data collection based on the selected market.
Create functions to switch between different collectors or adjust URLs/parameters according to the chosen market.
3. Handle Multi-Market Impact of Articles
Objective: Consider articles that could impact multiple markets (e.g., economic policy news affecting both stock and forex).
Approach:
Develop a way to analyze an articleâ€™s impact on multiple markets.
Assign weights or scores to determine how relevant a piece of news is to each market.
Modify feature engineering to include multi-market relationships.
Starting Point: Integrating Additional News Source for Bitcoin Market
Step 1: Research and Select a New News API

Find an API that supports historical data collection for the Bitcoin or general cryptocurrency market.
Identify the requirements for the API key, rate limits, and data structure.
Step 2: Create a New Collector for Bitcoin Market

Develop a CryptoNewsCollector class, similar to NewsCollector, specifically for cryptocurrency news.
Implement methods to fetch historical news data based on the selected API.
Step 3: Integrate with Market Data

Modify MarketDataCollector to include the capability to fetch Bitcoin market data from sources like CoinGecko or CryptoCompare.
Ensure compatibility of the timeframes between market data and news data.
Step 4: Test Integration

Collect data for Bitcoin from both news and market sources.
Visualize the collected data to confirm the correct alignment and consistency.
